Key Differences:

    Data Structure:

        Heap sort relies on a binary heap data structure, which is a specialized tree-based data structure. This is a fundamental difference from the other algorithms.
        Bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort operate directly on arrays without using additional data structures.
        Merge sort uses additional temporary arrays during the merging process.
        Quick sort uses recursive function calls, and the depth of the recursive calls create a call stack that uses memory.
   
    Time Complexity:

        Bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort have a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, making them inefficient for large datasets.
        Merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort have a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases, which is significantly more efficient for larger datasets.
        Although quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which can occur in certain scenarios. Heap sort consistently maintains O(n log n) time complexity.
        
    Mechanism:

        Heap sort works by building a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap.
        Bubble sort repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements.
        Insertion sort builds a sorted subarray by inserting elements into their correct positions.
        Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element and places it in its correct position.
        Merge sort uses a divide and conquer strategy, recursively dividing the array into halves and then merging them.
        Quick sort also uses a divide and conquer strategy, but it partitions the array around a pivot element.
    
    In-Place Sorting:

        Heap sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires minimal additional memory.
        Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and quick sort (with optimizations) are also generally considered in-place.
        Merge sort, in its standard implementation, is not in-place because it requires additional memory for the merging process.
    
    Stability:

        Heap sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it may not preserve the relative order of equal elements.
        Bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort can be implemented as stable sorting algorithms.
        Selection sort and quick sort are generally not stable.
        
    In summary:

        Heap sort's use of the heap data structure sets it apart from the other algorithms. Its consistent O(n log n) time complexity and in-place nature make it a valuable sorting algorithm.



// Heap Sort Algorithm (Reflecting provided Java code)

function heapSort(array):
  heapSort(array, naturalOrderComparator) // Use natural ordering if no comparator is provided.

function heapSort(array, comparator):
  n = length(array)

  // 1. Build Max Heap (O(n) time)
  for i = floor(n / 2) - 1 down to 0:
    heapify(array, n, i, comparator)

  // 2. Extract elements from heap one by one (O(n log n) time)
  for i = n - 1 down to 1:
    swap(array, 0, i) // Move current max to end
    heapify(array, i, 0, comparator) // Heapify the reduced heap

function heapify(array, n, i, comparator):
  largest = i
  left = 2 * i + 1
  right = 2 * i + 2

  // If left child is larger than root (using comparator)
  if left < n and comparator.compare(array[left], array[largest]) > 0:
    largest = left

  // If right child is larger than largest so far (using comparator)
  if right < n and comparator.compare(array[right], array[largest]) > 0:
    largest = right

  // If largest is not root
  if largest != i:
    swap(array, i, largest)
    heapify(array, n, largest, comparator)

function swap(array, i, j):
  temp = array[i]
  array[i] = array[j]
  array[j] = temp

//------------------------------------------------------------------
// Counting Analysis
//------------------------------------------------------------------

// 1. buildMaxHeap(array, n, comparator)
//    - loop: n/2 iterations (approximately)
//    - heapify: O(log n) worst case (height of the heap)
//    - comparator.compare() : O(1)
//    - Total: O(n/2 * log n), which simplifies to O(n) due to heap properties.

// 2. Extract elements from heap one by one
//    - loop: n-1 iterations
//    - swap: O(1)
//    - heapify: O(log n) worst case
//    - comparator.compare() : O(1)
//    - Total: O(n * log n)

// Overall Time Complexity:
//    - O(n) + O(n log n) = O(n log n)

//------------------------------------------------------------------
// Detailed Counting Analysis of heapify()
//------------------------------------------------------------------

// heapify(array, n, i, comparator):
//   - Comparisons: At most 2 comparisons per level (left and right children) using comparator.compare()
//   - Swaps: At most 1 swap per level
//   - Recursive calls: At most 1 recursive call per level
//   - The height of the heap is log2(n)
//   - In the worst case, the heapify function may traverse the entire height of the heap.
//   - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of heapify is O(log n).
//   - The comparator.compare() is considered O(1)

// Detailed Counting Analysis of buildMaxHeap()
// In buildMaxHeap the main loop runs n/2 times.
// The heapify function runs at most log(n) times.
// So one could conclude that the total time is n/2 * log(n) = O(n log(n)).
// However, a tighter bound can be obtained.
// The heapify function runs at O(log(n)) only at the root level.
// At the lowest level, the heapify function runs constant time.
// It can be shown that the buildMaxHeap function runs in O(n) time.

// Detailed Counting Analysis of heapSort()
// The heapSort function first calls buildMaxHeap, which takes O(n) time.
// Then, it runs a loop n-1 times, each time calling heapify, which takes O(log(n)) time.
// So the total time is O(n) + (n-1)*O(log(n)) = O(n log(n)).
